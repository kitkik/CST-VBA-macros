# CST-VBA-macros
Various useful VB code snippets for CST Microwave studio.

The repository contains various macros on VB, which I periodically use in CST Microwave studio. Below is a list of macros.
1) A macro for adding a list of monitors at different frequencies to calculate the antenna pattern in the far zone (Fairfield monitor);
2) A macro for writing to a text file the calculated Etheta and Ephi complex components of the antenna pattern in the far zone at various frequencies;
3) A macro for writing complex data of the calculated electric field strength (E-Field monitor) in Cartesian CS (x,y,z) to a text file.
   There is also a C# code attached to read the file with the coordinates of the nodes for which the calculation was performed.
